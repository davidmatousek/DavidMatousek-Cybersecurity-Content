# Claude Code Security Development Assistant Integration

This directory contains the SecurityManifesto.md file that transforms Claude Code into a security-first development assistant. Follow these instructions to integrate it into your Claude Code project.

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Copy the SecurityManifesto.md file
Copy the `SecurityManifesto.md` file to your project's root directory or a dedicated directory like `docs/` or `.claude/`.

### Step 2: Update your CLAUDE.md file
Add a reference to the SecurityManifesto.md in your `CLAUDE.md` file:

```markdown
## Security Guidelines

Claude Code must follow the security principles outlined in `SecurityManifesto.md` for all code generation, file operations, and development assistance. This includes mandatory security checks, secure coding practices, and security-first development approach as defined in the manifesto.
```

Ensure the SecurityManifesto.md file is in the same directory as your CLAUDE.md or provide the correct path.

## What This Does

Once integrated, Claude Code will:

- Enforce secure coding practices by default
- Validate all external inputs in generated code
- Never include hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Use memory-safe languages and practices
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Include security logging and error handling
- Apply encryption and secure communication protocols
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Suggest security testing and dependency scanning

## CLAUDE.md Configuration Examples

### For Web Applications:
```markdown
# Project Security Requirements
Follow the SecurityManifesto.md guidelines with special attention to:
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Secure session management
```

### For API Projects:
```markdown
# API Security Focus
Apply SecurityManifesto.md principles with emphasis on:
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth2)
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- API versioning security
```

### For Database-Heavy Projects:
```markdown
# Database Security Priority
Use SecurityManifesto.md with focus on:
- Parameterized queries only
- Connection security and encryption
- Proper access control implementation
```

## Verification

After setup, test that the security guidelines are working by asking Claude Code to generate a simple login function or API endpoint. You should see security features included by default.

## Security Benefits

This integration ensures your Claude Code assistant will:

 Generate secure code by default  
 Never create vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS  
 Include proper input validation  
 Implement authentication and authorization  
 Use secure communication protocols  
 Follow security best practices for your tech stack  
 Suggest security testing approaches  

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Claude Code isn't following security guidelines  
**Solution**: Ensure SecurityManifesto.md content is at the beginning of your CLAUDE.md file for maximum visibility.

**Issue**: Getting overly restrictive security responses  
**Solution**: You can request specific functionality with "while maintaining security best practices" to balance security with functionality.
